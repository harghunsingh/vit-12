A very special thanks to our mentors, Mr. Carlyle Pereira of Armman and Mr. Shreesh Naik of Inscripts, with whose support we were determined to follow a project plan that would help us in systematic completion and organized testing of our project.
Our initial assessment included an intensive requirements analysis. We identified the various functional and non-functional requirements that would be needed for mMitra keeping in mind the users of the app.
Once the requirements analysis was complete, a design analysis of the existing app in the Sana 1.0 version was carried out by following the Human Centred Design and adopting Agile Development Methodology.
